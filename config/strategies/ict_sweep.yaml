# ICT Liquidity Sweep Strategy Configuration
#
# Entry Logic:
# 1. Liquidity Sweep - Price sweeps swing high/low (stop hunt)
# 2. Displacement - Strong rejection candle (2x+ avg body)
# 3. FVG Forms - Fair Value Gap created during displacement
# 4. FVG Mitigation - Price retraces into FVG zone
# 5. LTF MSS Confirms - Market Structure Shift on 1m

# ===== INSTRUMENT SETTINGS =====
symbol: "ES"
tick_size: 0.25
tick_value: 12.50  # ES=$12.50, NQ=$5.00, MES=$1.25, MNQ=$0.50
contracts: 3

# ===== TIMEFRAME SETTINGS =====
timeframes:
  htf: "5m"   # Higher timeframe for setup detection
  ltf: "1m"   # Lower timeframe for MSS confirmation

# ===== LIQUIDITY DETECTION =====
liquidity:
  # Swing point detection
  swing_lookback: 20        # Bars to search for swing points
  swing_strength: 3         # Bars on each side to confirm swing
  max_levels: 5             # Max liquidity levels to track

# ===== SWEEP DETECTION =====
sweep:
  min_sweep_ticks: 2        # Minimum ticks beyond swing level
  max_sweep_ticks: 20       # Maximum sweep depth (too deep = not a sweep)
  check_bars: 3             # Recent bars to check for sweep

# ===== DISPLACEMENT =====
displacement:
  multiplier: 2.0           # Body must be >= 2x average body
  avg_body_lookback: 20     # Bars to calculate average body

# ===== FVG (Fair Value Gap) =====
fvg:
  min_size_ticks:
    ES: 5                   # Minimum FVG size for ES
    NQ: 15                  # Minimum FVG size for NQ
    MES: 5
    MNQ: 15
  max_age_bars: 50          # Remove FVGs older than this

# ===== MSS (Market Structure Shift) =====
mss:
  lookback: 10              # Bars to find swing for MSS
  swing_strength: 2         # Bars on each side for LTF swing

# ===== STOP LOSS =====
stop:
  buffer_ticks: 2           # Ticks beyond sweep point
  max_risk_ticks: 40        # Maximum allowed risk in ticks

# ===== TARGETS =====
targets:
  t1_multiplier: 2.0        # T1 at 2R (50% exit)
  t2_multiplier: 4.0        # T2 at 4R (remaining)
  use_opposing_liquidity: true  # Runner to opposing swing

# ===== SESSION FILTER =====
session:
  start: "09:30"            # NY session start (ET)
  end: "16:00"              # NY session end (ET)
  allow_lunch: false        # Skip 12:00-13:00 lunch lull
  require_killzone: false   # Only trade NY Open/PM killzones

  # Killzones (for reference)
  killzones:
    NY_OPEN:
      start: "09:30"
      end: "11:00"
    NY_PM:
      start: "13:30"
      end: "16:00"
    LONDON:
      start: "02:00"
      end: "05:00"

# ===== RISK MANAGEMENT =====
risk:
  max_daily_trades: 5       # Maximum trades per day
  max_daily_losses: 2       # Stop after N losses
  max_position_size: 3      # Max contracts per trade

# ===== BACKTEST SETTINGS =====
backtest:
  days: 14
  initial_capital: 50000
  commission_per_contract: 2.50
